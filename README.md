# Started-Latex-To-Jupyter-Notebooks-Conversion
I have started converting markdown files to Jupyter Notebooks. I have completed 4 files and I will complete everything within 3-4 weeks. Let me know where I need to improve. 

First I used Pandoc to convert .tex files to .md,
then I used Notedown (https://github.com/aaren/notedown) to convert these .md files to .ipynb format.
After some manual editing and solving some small errors everything was done.
